    description: `Like several other heavily visited European cities, Amsterdam experienced a dramatic pause in tourism during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. With the Netherlands' borders closed and major attractions like the Rijksmuseum emptied of the usual throngs of international visitors, locals were able to reclaim the historic heart of the city.
    Now, Amsterdam's leaders are determined to permanently shift the economic balance between residents and tourists, and rethink Amsterdam's free-wheeling image as a magnet for sex- and drug-seeking vacationers. "People who have lived here for a very long time feel estranged," says the city's mayor, Femke Halsema. "We do not want to become Venice or Dubrovnik, where your historical center has become a closed theme park. In the future it has to be a livable part of the city."
    
    Appointed to the post in 2018 as Amsterdam's first female mayor, Halsema was previously the leader of the Dutch Green Left Party, and she feels her liberal political background will help her convince the city council to join her efforts to rein in the city's cannabis-dispensing coffeeshops and its famous sex industry. Halsema is also currently wrestling with a housing affordability crisis: The cost of living in Amsterdam has long been a concern for economists and local officials, who point to the chronically low level of housing supply and increasing influence of short-term rental services like Airbnb.`,

    description: `A housing association in the United Kingdom kept collecting rent from a tenant when she lay dead in her house for more than two years, an inquest has been told. According to the BBC, 58-year-old Sheila Seleoane had to be identified by dental records after her skeletal remains were found on the sofa in the living room of her flat in Peckham in February. Housing society Peabody has apologised for what happened. The inquest was held to determine the case of Mr Seleoane's death.
    The post-mortem report could not ascertain the cause of Ms Seleoane's death due to the advanced state of decomposition of her body. London's South Coroner court, where the inquest was held, was also told that the woman suffered from Crohn's disease and bowel inflammation.
    
    "Any death is sad. To lie undetected for in all likelihood over two years, is difficult to fathom in 2022," said coroner Julian Morris, as he concluded the inquest.
    
    The case attracted publicity because of the unusual length of time Ms Seleoane's body went undisturbed at the residential area, Lord's Court. Ms Seleoane was last seen alive when she visited a doctor in August 2019.
    
    
    An independent inquiry was also held which slammed the housing society for its failure to detect that the tenant had died.

    description: `Mumbai: Actor Salman Khan has applied for a gun licence after he and his father got a death threat in early June, just days after singer Sidhu Moose Wala was shot dead near Punjab's Mansa on May 29.
    The actor came to the Mumbai Police headquarters today and met with top cop Vivek Phansalkar for a gun licence, people with direct knowledge of the matter said. Salman Khan wants to own a gun to protect himself and his family, they said.
    
    His visit to the police headquarters was for physical verification before the licensing authority, a mandatory step in applying for a gun licence, sources said.
    
    Salman Khan and his father Salim Khan had received a threat letter in early June, just days after Sidhu Moose Wala was shot dead by members of gangster Lawrence Bishnoi, who had threatened the actor in 2018 too.
    
    Lawrence Bishnoi's death threat to Salman Khan was linked to the black buck poaching case of 1998, in which the actor was one of the accused.
    
    The actor's father had found the unsigned letter on a bench where he sits daily after jogging in the morning.
    
    Comments
    Lawrence Bishnoi, who had been serving time in Delhi's Tihar Jail, is in Punjab Police custody in connection with the investigation into the murder of Sidhu Moose Wala.`,

    description: `Bengaluru: Former Karnataka Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa won a reprieve today from the Supreme Court, which put on hold criminal proceedings in a corruption case against him.
    The Karnataka High Court had earlier refused to cancel an FIR (First Information Report) registered against Mr Yediyurappa, 79, in a land allocation scam. 
    
    The senior BJP leader is accused of releasing acres of land acquired by the state government and illegally allotting the land to entrepreneurs in 2006-7, when he was Deputy Chief Minister of Karnataka. A case was registered against him under the Prevention of Corruption Act. 
    
    In 2020, the High Court rejected his request that the FIR registered by the Karnataka Lokayukta police be cancelled. High Court judge John Michael Cunha reprimanded the police for delaying the investigation and said, "The circumstances clearly indicate the delay is intentional and deliberate."`,

    description: `A Big Verdict In Favour Of NDTV And Its Founders
    Allegations that the founders of NDTV, Radhika and Prannoy Roy, ceded control of New Delhi Television Limited through a personal loan taken in 2009-10 are "a figment of imagination", "against the material evidence on record" and "wholly erroneous," the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) has ruled in its order dated July 20, 2022 (made available on July 21, 2022).
    While declaring completely legitimate the terms of the personal loan between the NDTV founders and a company named Vishvapradhan Commercial Private Limited (VCPL), the verdict says, "The transaction does not acquire direct or indirect control of NDTV. The intent and language of the loan agreement and call option agreements read with the SAST Regulations makes it clear that there is no direct or indirect control of NDTV by VCPL."
    
    With these and other strong observations in favour of the NDTV founders, SAT's verdict overturns an earlier order by SEBI dated June 14, 2019, and states the order which had barred them "from accessing the securities market or from accepting any position of a Director is totally out of context and does not commensurate with the alleged violation especially when no fraud has been committed nor does the loan agreement defraud the investors."`,
